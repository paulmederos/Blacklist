Welcome to the Blacklist project.

Some things you should know to get this project running on your machine:
=================================================

  #0: Rails 3.1 project
  #1: Written in Ruby 1.9.2. Install as appropriate
  #2: We do need several things to be running at the same time for our environment.
      The Procfile_development, with the Foreman gem, will run this for you.

  	   Just run Foreman like so:

         bundle exec foreman start -f Procfile_development

  	   Procfile_devlopment is named such because we don't want to run Solr on Heroku (WebSolr FTW)

  	   I suggest you create a shell alias for this command. Something like fore_dev
